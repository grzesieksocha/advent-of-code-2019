# Advent of Code 2019

Developed on Python 3.8 (needed hypot in 3-dimensional space)

```python day_{day_number}.py```

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)

### [Day 10]((https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10))
Work on a better solution (collect unique vectors with visible asteroid) - used a bit in part 2.
Analyzing Dementophobia repo helped a lot!

### [Day 12]((https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/12))
Due to lack of time I had to search for help for part 2. Brute force using hypot would take aaaages. I found help with explanation [here](https://github.com/gboyegadada/algos/blob/master/AoC19/day12.py)

I would love to animate it!

### [Day 14]((https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/14))
Really messed up with the structure of the input data... Lesson learned ;)
